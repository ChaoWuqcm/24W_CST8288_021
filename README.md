Welcome to the Food Waste Reduction Platform, an innovative solution designed to combat the global issue of food waste. This document serves as a guide to the conceptualization and implementation of this platform, which aims to connect food retailers, consumers, and charitable organizations in a collaborative effort to reduce waste and promote sustainability.

Food waste is a pressing concern with profound environmental, social, and economic implications. By facilitating the efficient redistribution of surplus food, our platform strives to minimize waste, alleviate hunger, and foster resilient food ecosystems.
